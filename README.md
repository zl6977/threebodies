# threebodies
The three-body problem is a well-known nonlinear dynamic problem. 
Unlike two-body problem, there is no closed-form solution, so numerical methods are generally required. 
It is interesting and challenging to simulate the three-body motion because of its chaotic property.

- Wrote the IVP ODE solver in C++ using the 4th order Rungeâ€“Kutta method 

- Selected some special initial conditions to gain the special-case solutions for the ornamental visual effect 

- Rendered the 3D animation of 3 bodies movement with OpenGL using data generated by the solver.

- Unluckily, the source code about QT GUI is missed.
